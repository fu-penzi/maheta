Figma project: https://www.figma.com/file/0Pzn4AXPqLykVoBipj7dID/Maheta?node-id=2%3A4
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.5.

## General information
Maheta is a mobile app for language learners. It let's you play songs, display lyrics and translate words on the fly.

Main functionality:
- play songs stored in phone memory
- create songs playlists
- add lyrics to song
- lookup translation of words

REST API service was created using Flask microframework and it uses Azure Translator service for translations (it's no longer UP, because my student Azure subscription ended).


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
